## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Current Status
- Unit test templates created for AuthService and AuthController
- E2E test template created for authentication endpoints
- Testing framework configured with Jest and Supertest

### Planned Testing Approach
- **Unit Tests**: Service logic, utilities, and individual components
- **Integration Tests**: Database operations and API endpoint validation
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflows and business processes
- **Security Tests**: Authentication, authorization, and input validation
- **Performance Tests**: Database queries and API response times

### Test Coverage Goals
- Minimum 80% code coverage for critical business logic
- 100% coverage for authentication and security components
- Integration tests for all API endpoints
- Database transaction testing with rollback scenarios

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Current Security Measures
- **Database Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with secure token generation
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with 12 salt rounds
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive DTO validation with class-validator
- **Environment Security**: Sensitive credentials in environment variables
- **Error Handling**: Generic error messages to prevent information leakage
- **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript typing throughout the application

### Planned Security Enhancements
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Request throttling and DDoS protection
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS protection with content sanitization
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Security headers and HTTPS enforcement
- JWT token refresh mechanism
- Account lockout after failed attempts

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+ (compatible with v23.7.0)
- PostgreSQL database (via Supabase)
- Git for version control

### Development Setup

#### Backend Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Zain4391/event-planner-app.git
cd event-planner-app/backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add your Supabase credentials and JWT secret

# Verify database connection
npx drizzle-kit introspect

# Start development server
npm run start:dev

# Run tests
npm run test
npm run test:e2e
```

#### Frontend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd ../frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
npm run start
```

#### Full-Stack Development
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm run start:dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3001
- Backend API: http://localhost:3000

### Development Notes
- **Backend**: Runs on port 3000 with CORS enabled for frontend
- **Frontend**: Runs on port 3001 with Next.js development server
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens stored in localStorage
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier configured (needs formatting fixes)

### Database Setup
1. Create Supabase project and obtain credentials
2. Run the provided SQL schema in Supabase SQL editor
3. Enable Row Level Security on all tables
4. Configure environment variables with connection details

## 👥 Team & Methodology

### Development Approach
- **Mentored Development**: Step-by-step guided implementation
- **Best Practices Focus**: Industry standards and modern patterns
- **Security-First**: Security considerations in every development phase
- **Incremental Development**: Feature completion before moving forward
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Test-driven development practices

## 📝 Key Learnings & Decisions

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Authentication Strategy**: Chose traditional JWT over Clerk for learning purposes
2. **Database ORM**: Selected Drizzle for type safety and performance
3. **Development Pattern**: Step-by-step development over rapid prototyping
4. **Testing Approach**: Comprehensive testing from the start
5. **Security Model**: Database-level security with application-level validation
6. **Error Handling**: Service-level error codes mapped to HTTP exceptions
7. **Validation Strategy**: DTO-based validation with class-validator

### Development Philosophy
- Understanding before implementation
- Security and scalability from day one
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Clean, maintainable, and documented code
- Modern development practices and patterns
